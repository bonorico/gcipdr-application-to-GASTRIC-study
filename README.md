# gcipdr-application-to-GASTRIC-study

Run file "main.R" for main analysis.

Run files "sim_study*.R" for simulation analyses (beware each file can take up to 24 hours to execute on 2 cores). Simulations were made with R 3.6.3 under a Linux 5.4.0-81-generic 18.04.1-Ubuntu system on a Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2640M CPU @ 2.80GHz machine.  

This analysis was presented in [Survival analysis without sharing of individual patient data by using a Gaussian copula](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pst.2415)
